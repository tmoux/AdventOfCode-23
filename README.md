## Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

Each day is contained in a separate folder.
I write C++ solutions for speed (to attempt to make it on the leaderboard). I won't try to clean up these solutions; they may contain debug output and other nonsense. They can be compiled with the Makefile in each folder.

I will also try to write some cleaner solutions in other languages.
Currently I'm trying to use Haskell; these solutions can be run using `cabal run Day{X} < input` in the root directory.

Per the creator's request, problem inputs will not be uploaded.
Unless otherwise specified, programs read from standard input and print to standard output.

| Day | Time (Part 1 / 2)    | Rank          |
|-----|----------------------|---------------|
| 1   | 00:02:08 / 00:07:42  | 250 / 149     |
